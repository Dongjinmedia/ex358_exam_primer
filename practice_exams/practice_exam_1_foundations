# Nodes

- ctrl01 - A single control node
- node01
- node02
- node03

Required Pre-Tasks

0.  Configure ansible as follows

  - ansible should already be installed.
  - `ansible` user should be created on all nodes
  - directory `exam` should be created under `ansible` home directory on `cn01`
  - `ansible` user should able to become root via sudo on `node01` and `cn01 without being prompted for the password.
  - `ansible` user should able to login into all nodes without being prompted for the password.

From this point, every playbook and role should be created under `/home/ansible/exam` on `cn01`.

Exam tasks

1. Create inventory file on /etc/ansible/inventory on `cn01` and configure `ansible.cfg` to use that inventory. The inventory should contain:

- group `nodes` with `node01` and `node02`
- group `infra` with `node03`

2. Install Red Hat system roles on `cn01`

3. Create a playbook `loop-all-ips.yml` that can print all the ips for each host in the inventory.

4. Create a playbook `nfs-configure.yml` that installs `nfs` service on `node01`, but prevents from starting.

5. Write a playbook `setup-logs.yml`:

 - Configure rsyslog on `node03` to accept logs on port *601*.
 - Allow inbound traffic on port *601* from group `nodes`
 - Configures instances in group `nodes` to send rsyslogs to `node03`

6. Write a playbook `apache-setup.yml` to apply the follow for all instances in group `nodes`:

- Install apache and have it start up automatically.
- Create directory `/www`
- Configure a virtual site to list on port *8888* with the document root pointing to `/www`
- Create an index page call "Hello, People!" in `/www`
- Allow inbound access on port *8888* from `cn01` *only*.
